# Navigation Testing Solution for JSDOM Limitations

## Problem

JSDOM, the JavaScript DOM implementation used in Vitest testing, doesn't fully implement the Navigation API. This causes "Not implemented: navigation (except hash changes)" warnings when testing React Router components, even though the tests pass.

## Solution Overview

We implemented a comprehensive solution with three main components:

### 1. Navigation API Mocking (`jsdom-navigation-mock.ts`)

- Provides complete mocks for `window.navigation`, `window.history`, and location methods
- Prevents JSDOM from attempting to use unimplemented navigation APIs
- Exports mocks for test verification and interaction tracking

### 2. Console Suppression (`setup.ts`)

- Filters out JSDOM navigation warnings from console.error and process.stderr
- Preserves all other error messages for debugging
- Automatically restores original console methods after tests

### 3. Enhanced React Router Testing (`NavMenu.test.tsx`)

- Mocks React Router's `useNavigate` and `useLocation` hooks
- Uses `MemoryRouter` for isolated navigation testing
- Replaces `Link` components with test-friendly alternatives
- Includes comprehensive tests for navigation behavior without browser dependencies

## Key Benefits

### ✅ Clean Test Output

- Eliminates "Not implemented: navigation" warnings
- Preserves important error messages
- Improves test readability and CI output

### ✅ Comprehensive Navigation Testing

- Tests React Router integration without browser navigation
- Verifies navigation calls and state changes
- Maintains full test coverage for navigation functionality

### ✅ JSDOM Compatibility

- Works within JSDOM's limitations
- Provides fallbacks for unimplemented APIs
- Maintains test performance and reliability

## Implementation Files

1. **`src/test/jsdom-navigation-mock.ts`** - Navigation API mocks
2. **`src/test/setup.ts`** - Console suppression and global setup
3. **`src/components/navigation/NavMenu.test.tsx`** - Enhanced navigation tests

## Usage in Other Tests

For new navigation-related tests, import the navigation mocks:

```typescript
import { navigationMocks, resetNavigationMocks } from '../../test/jsdom-navigation-mock'

beforeEach(() => {
  resetNavigationMocks()
})

// Verify navigation calls
expect(navigationMocks.navigation.navigate).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/path')
```

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Custom JSDOM Environment** - More complex setup, unnecessary for this use case
2. **Browser Testing (Playwright)** - Slower, overkill for unit tests
3. **Ignoring Warnings** - Doesn't address the root cause
4. **Mocking Only React Router** - Incomplete, still produces JSDOM warnings

## Test Results

- ✅ All 71 NavMenu tests pass
- ✅ No JSDOM navigation warnings
- ✅ Full navigation functionality coverage
- ✅ Compatible with existing test infrastructure
