# Phase 2: Core Domain Implementation - Detailed Plan

## Overview
**Goal**: Implement the core domain layer with SEC filing business logic
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - 97.89% test coverage, 171 unit tests passing

## Architecture Decision
**Simplified Domain Model**: Focus on analysis results storage while leveraging edgartools for all SEC data access. This approach achieved ~80% code reduction by removing duplicate functionality.

## Task Breakdown

### **Value Objects Foundation** - ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: 6 value objects implemented with full validation and test coverage

#### SEC Identifiers
- [x] **CIK** - Central Index Key validation with 10-digit format
- [x] **Ticker** - Company ticker symbol validation (1-5 uppercase letters)
- [x] **AccessionNumber** - SEC accession number format validation

#### Financial and Business Types
- [x] **FilingType** - SEC filing type enumeration with amendment detection
- [x] **Money** - Financial amounts with currency support and arithmetic operations
- [x] **ProcessingStatus** - Analysis pipeline state tracking with transition validation

#### Removed Value Objects
- [x] **~~FilingDate~~** - Removed (use edgartools fiscal year/quarter logic)
- [x] **~~FinancialPeriod~~** - Removed (use edgartools XBRL period data)

### **Core Entities** - ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: 3 entities implemented with focus on analysis capabilities

#### Analysis-Focused Entities
- [x] **Analysis** - Rich entity for storing LLM analysis results
  - 11 business methods for insights, risks, opportunities
  - Confidence scoring and classification
  - Structured results storage with metadata
  - Support for multiple analysis types

- [x] **Company** - Minimal reference entity
  - Essential identifiers (id, cik, name)
  - Metadata storage for analysis context
  - Proper validation and invariants

- [x] **Filing** - Processing tracker
  - State machine for processing workflow
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Company relationship management

#### Removed Entities
- [x] **~~FinancialStatement~~** - Removed (use edgartools financial data)
- [x] **~~FinancialLineItem~~** - Removed (use edgartools line item data)
- [x] **~~XBRLFact~~** - Removed (use edgartools XBRL parsing)

### **Repository Interfaces** - ✅ SKIPPED FOR PHASE 3
**Decision**: Repository interfaces will be implemented directly in Phase 3 alongside concrete implementations to avoid over-abstraction.

### **Domain Services & Events** - ✅ SKIPPED FOR PHASE 3
**Decision**: Domain services and events will be implemented directly in Phase 3 as part of the application layer to avoid unnecessary abstraction.

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Achieved
- **Value Objects**: 100% coverage with comprehensive validation tests
- **Entities**: 97.89% coverage with business logic verification
- **Total**: 171 unit tests passing
- **Type Safety**: MyPy strict mode compliance

### Test Structure
- Edge case testing for boundary values
- Business logic verification for state transitions
- Validation testing for all value objects
- Encapsulation testing for entity invariants

## Key Simplification Decisions

### What are Kept (Core Analysis Focus)
- **Analysis Entity**: Full implementation - core differentiator for LLM insights
- **Money**: Essential for financial calculations and precision
- **ProcessingStatus**: Critical for analysis pipeline workflow
- **Company/Filing**: Minimal entities for analysis context

### What are Simplified
- **SEC Identifiers**: Kept validation, removed edgartools-duplicate methods
- **FilingType**: Kept enumeration and amendment detection only

### What are Removed
- **Financial Data Entities**: All removed - use edgartools directly
- **XBRL Entities**: All removed - use edgartools XBRL parsing
- **Date/Period Objects**: All removed - use edgartools temporal logic

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Code reduction** by removing duplicate functionality
2. **Clear separation of concerns** - edgartools for SEC data, Aperilex for analysis
3. **Focused codebase** - every line serves the analysis mission
4. **Better maintainability** - fewer moving parts, cleaner architecture
5. **Leverages expertise** - edgartools handles SEC compliance, we handle analysis

## Phase 2 Success Criteria - ✅ ACHIEVED

- [x] **Value Objects**: Domain foundation complete with full validation
- [x] **Entities**: Business logic encapsulated in analysis-focused entities
- [x] **Domain Independence**: Completely independent of infrastructure
- [x] **Business Rules**: All analysis rules enforced in domain layer
- [x] **Type Safety**: MyPy strict mode compliance
- [x] **Test Coverage**: 97.89% coverage exceeding 95% target
- [x] **Clean Architecture**: DDD principles followed
- [x] **Ready for Phase 3**: Infrastructure layer can be implemented

## EdgarTools Integration Notes

**Reference**: Context7 Library ID `/dgunning/edgartools`

**Aperilex Role**: Focus on analysis orchestration, results storage, and insight generation while leveraging edgartools for:
- All SEC data retrieval and parsing
- Company and filing detailed information
- XBRL fact structure and financial statements
- Business rule validation and SEC compliance
- Financial data formatting and calculations

This strategic decision allows Aperilex to focus on its core value proposition: AI-powered analysis and insights generation.
