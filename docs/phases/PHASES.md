- **Development Environment**: Docker Compose with PostgreSQL and Redis
- **Database Setup**: Alembic migrations configured
- **Code Quality**: MyPy, Ruff, Black, and isort configured
- **Security**: Basic security scanning with Bandit and Safety

#### Technical Decisions:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- **Cache**: Redis for caching layer
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with async support
- **API Framework**: FastAPI with Pydantic v2

- `CLAUDE.md`: Development context and standards

### Phase 2: Core Domain Implementation - âœ… COMPLETED
**Status**: Complete - 97.89% test coverage, 171 unit tests passing

#### Achievements:
- âœ… Simplified domain model focusing on analysis results
- âœ… Removed duplicate edgartools functionality (~80% code reduction)
- âœ… Implemented core entities: Analysis, Company, Filing
- âœ… Created essential value objects: Money, ProcessingStatus, Ticker, FilingType, CIK, AccessionNumber
- âœ… Comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
- âœ… MyPy strict mode compliance

#### Key Deliverables:
1. **Domain Entities** (Analysis-focused):
   - `Analysis` entity - Rich model for storing LLM analysis results with 11 business methods
   - `Company` entity - Minimal reference (id, cik, name, metadata)
   - `Filing` entity - Processing tracker with state machine

2. **Value Objects**:
