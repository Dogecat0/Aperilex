# Aperilex Development Phases

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Security - ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Complete

#### Achievements:
- ✅ Project structure established with clean architecture
- ✅ Dependencies installed via Poetry
- ✅ Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis) configured and running
- ✅ Database initialized with Alembic migrations
- ✅ Basic FastAPI application running
- ✅ Development environment fully operational
- ✅ Type checking issues resolved and mypy configuration updated

#### Key Components Delivered:
- **Project Structure**: Clean architecture with domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers
- **Development Environment**: Docker Compose with PostgreSQL and Redis
- **Database Setup**: Alembic migrations configured
- **Code Quality**: MyPy, Ruff, Black, and isort configured
- **Security**: Basic security scanning with Bandit and Safety

#### Technical Decisions:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- **Cache**: Redis for caching layer
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with async support
- **API Framework**: FastAPI with Pydantic v2
- **Type Checking**: Strict mypy configuration with targeted overrides

#### Configuration Files:
- `pyproject.toml`: Poetry dependencies and tool configurations
- `alembic.ini`: Database migration configuration
- `docker-compose.yml`: Development services
- `CLAUDE.md`: Development context and standards

### Phase 2: Core Domain Implementation - ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Complete - 97.89% test coverage, 171 unit tests passing

#### Achievements:
- ✅ Simplified domain model focusing on analysis results
- ✅ Removed duplicate edgartools functionality (~80% code reduction)
- ✅ Implemented core entities: Analysis, Company, Filing
- ✅ Created essential value objects: Money, ProcessingStatus, Ticker, FilingType, CIK, AccessionNumber
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
- ✅ MyPy strict mode compliance

#### Key Deliverables:
1. **Domain Entities** (Analysis-focused):
   - `Analysis` entity - Rich model for storing LLM analysis results with 11 business methods
   - `Company` entity - Minimal reference (id, cik, name, metadata)
   - `Filing` entity - Processing tracker with state machine

2. **Value Objects**:
   - `Money` - Financial amounts with currency and arithmetic
   - `ProcessingStatus` - Analysis pipeline state tracking
   - `Ticker` - Company ticker symbol validation
   - `FilingType` - SEC filing type enumeration
   - `CIK` - Central Index Key validation
   - `AccessionNumber` - SEC accession number validation

#### Design Decisions:
- **Removed**: FinancialStatement, XBRLData, Transaction entities (use edgartools)
- **Focus**: Analysis results storage and insight generation
- **Integration**: Direct edgartools usage for all SEC data
- **Skipped**: Repository interfaces and domain services (implemented directly in Phase 3)

## Current Phase

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Layer - ✅ COMPLETED  
**Status**: Complete - Full infrastructure foundation with background processing and caching

#### Completed Deliverables:
1. **EdgarTools Integration** ✅:
   - EdgarService implemented with comprehensive filing retrieval
   - Flexible query parameters (year, quarter, date range, amendments)
   - Section extraction for 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K filings
   - Financial statement parsing capabilities
   - SEC identity configuration for compliance
   
2. **LLM Infrastructure** ✅:
   - BaseLLMProvider abstraction created
   - OpenAI provider fully implemented with structured output
   - Comprehensive analysis schemas for all filing sections
   - Hierarchical analysis with concurrent processing
   - Additional providers (Anthropic, Gemini, Cohere) deferred to future phases
   
3. **Repository Layer** ✅:
   - `BaseRepository` with common CRUD operations
   - `CompanyRepository` with CIK lookup and name search
   - `FilingRepository` with status tracking and batch operations
   - `AnalysisRepository` with complex querying capabilities
   - Full async support with SQLAlchemy 2.0+
   - Comprehensive integration tests (26 tests, 100% passing)

4. **Database Infrastructure** ✅:
   - SQLAlchemy models for Company, Filing, and Analysis entities
   - Alembic migrations created and tested (migration `4f48d5eb2b27`)
   - Proper indexes and foreign key constraints
   - JSON fields for metadata storage
   - User model removed (using string identifiers for created_by)

5. **Background Processing** ✅:
   - Celery application configuration with async task support
   - Dedicated task queues (filing_queue, analysis_queue)
   - Filing processing tasks (fetch, process, batch operations)
   - Analysis tasks (individual, comprehensive, batch analysis)
   - Docker services for celery-worker and celery-beat
   - Redis broker integration

6. **Caching Layer** ✅:
   - Redis service with async JSON serialization
   - High-level cache manager for domain entities
   - Smart TTL management (24h companies, 12h filings, 6h analyses)
   - Pattern-based cache invalidation
   - Cache statistics and health monitoring

7. **Testing Infrastructure** ✅:
   - Comprehensive integration tests for all repositories
   - End-to-end workflow tests (Edgar → LLM → Analysis)
   - Schema compatibility tests for OpenAI
   - All 242 tests passing with 67.5% coverage
   - MyPy and linting compliance maintained

#### Key Technical Achievements:
- **Async-First Architecture**: All infrastructure components use async/await for maximum performance
- **Background Processing**: Celery with dedicated queues for filing vs analysis workloads  
- **Multi-Level Caching**: Redis caching for entities, search results, and filing content
- **Domain-Driven Infrastructure**: Cache keys and task organization follow domain boundaries
- **Production-Ready Monitoring**: Task tracking, Redis health checks, and comprehensive logging
- **Type Safety**: Full MyPy compliance across all infrastructure components
- **Docker Integration**: Complete development environment with worker and scheduler services
- **Test Coverage**: All 242 tests passing with comprehensive integration testing

#### File Structure (Post-Reorganization):
```
src/infrastructure/
├── cache/                    # Caching infrastructure
│   ├── redis_service.py     # Low-level Redis operations

## Next Phase

### Phase 4: Application Services - 🔄 IN PROGRESS (17% Complete)
**Dependencies**: Complete Phase 3 ✅

#### Status Update:
**Progress**: 1/6 major components complete
- ✅ **Base CQRS Infrastructure** - Complete with 114 tests, 99.40% coverage
- 🔄 **Request/Response DTOs** - In progress (next component)
- ⏳ **Remaining components** - Pending

#### ✅ Completed Deliverables:
1. **Base CQRS Infrastructure**:
   - `BaseCommand` and `BaseQuery` abstract classes with validation
   - `CommandHandler` and `QueryHandler` interfaces with full type safety
   - `Dispatcher` with dependency injection and handler registration
   - Comprehensive error handling and structured logging
   - 114 unit tests with 99.40% coverage

#### 🔄 Revised Scope (Due to LLM Infrastructure Limitations):

**Analysis Use Cases** (Limited by current LLM capabilities):
- ✅ `AnalyzeFilingCommand` - Supported by existing `analyze_filing()` LLM method
- ❌ `GenerateInsightsCommand` - **POSTPONED** (requires multi-analysis LLM methods)
- ❌ `CompareAnalysesQuery` - **POSTPONED** (requires cross-analysis LLM capabilities)
   
**Domain Services** (Adjusted scope):
- ✅ `AnalysisOrchestrator` - Single-filing analysis coordination
- ❌ `InsightGenerator` - **POSTPONED** (depends on multi-analysis LLM infrastructure)
- ✅ `AnalysisTemplateService` - Manage LLM schema-based analysis configurations

**Rationale**: Current LLM infrastructure (`OpenAIProvider`) supports single-filing analysis only. Multi-analysis intelligence capabilities require additional LLM methods that don't exist yet and would require significant infrastructure development. 

### Phase 5: API Development - 📋 PLANNED
**Dependencies**: Complete Phase 4

#### Planned Deliverables:
1. **Core REST Endpoints**
2. **Advanced Analysis Endpoints**

### Phase 6: Enhanced Features - 📋 PLANNED
**Dependencies**: Complete Phase 5

#### Planned Deliverables:
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
2. **Monitoring & Analytics**
3. **Advanced Analysis Features**
