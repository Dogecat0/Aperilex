# Phase 3: Infrastructure Layer - Detailed Plan

## Overview
**Goal**: Implement infrastructure layer with direct edgartools integration and analysis capabilities  
**Status**: üöÄ ACTIVE - 60% Complete (Edgar and LLM infrastructure implemented)

## Progress Summary

### Completed Components ‚úÖ
- **EdgarTools Integration**: Fully implemented with EdgarService, flexible query parameters, and section extraction
- **LLM Provider Infrastructure**: BaseLLMProvider abstraction and OpenAI provider with structured output
- **Analysis Schemas**: Complete schemas for all major filing sections (Business, Risk Factors, MDA, Financial Statements)
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive tests covering Edgar ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Analysis workflow

### Remaining Components ‚ùå
- **Other LLM Providers**: Anthropic, Gemini, Cohere implementations pending
- **Repository Layer**: SQLAlchemy models and repository implementations not started
- **Database Migrations**: No Alembic migrations created yet
- **Background Processing**: Celery configuration and tasks not implemented
- **Caching Layer**: Redis integration for caching not implemented

## Dependencies
- ‚úÖ Phase 2 Complete: Domain layer with 97.89% test coverage
- ‚úÖ EdgarTools reference available: Context7 Library ID `/dgunning/edgartools`
- ‚úÖ Development environment operational: PostgreSQL, Redis, FastAPI

## Architecture Decision
**Skip Repository Interfaces**: Implement repositories directly with concrete implementations to avoid over-abstraction and accelerate development.
