# Phase 3: Infrastructure Layer - Detailed Plan

## Overview
**Goal**: Implement infrastructure layer with direct edgartools integration and analysis capabilities  
**Status**: ðŸš€ ACTIVE - Ready to begin implementation

## Dependencies
- âœ… Phase 2 Complete: Domain layer with 97.89% test coverage
- âœ… EdgarTools reference available: Context7 Library ID `/dgunning/edgartools`
- âœ… Development environment operational: PostgreSQL, Redis, FastAPI

## Architecture Decision
**Skip Repository Interfaces**: Implement repositories directly with concrete implementations to avoid over-abstraction and accelerate development.
