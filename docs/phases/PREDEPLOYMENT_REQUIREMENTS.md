# Pre-Deployment Requirements for Aperilex

## Overview

This document outlines the critical requirements that must be completed before Aperilex can be deployed to production. The application is functionally complete with all core features working, but requires specific production-ready configurations and monitoring.

## Current State

**Application Status**: ✅ Functionally Complete
- All core features implemented and tested
- Backend API fully operational with 85.61% test coverage
- Frontend application with 98% test pass rate
- Docker development environment working

**Production Readiness**: ⚠️ 4-5 days of work required

## Critical Requirements (MUST HAVE)

### 1. Google Analytics 4 Integration ⏳
**Priority**: HIGH | **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Purpose**: Track user engagement and usage patterns without implementing authentication

- [ ] Configure security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline ⏳
**Priority**: HIGH | **Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

**GitHub Actions Workflows**:
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for testing

- [ ] Configure branch protection rules
- [ ] Set up automated testing on PR

**Testing Pipeline**:
```yaml
- [ ] Backend unit tests (pytest)
- [ ] Backend integration tests
- [ ] Frontend unit tests (vitest)
- [ ] Frontend component tests
- [ ] Type checking (mypy, tsc)
- [ ] Linting (ruff, eslint)
- [ ] Code formatting checks
```

**Deployment Pipeline**:
- [ ] Build Docker images
- [ ] Push to container registry (Docker Hub/ECR/GCR)
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Deploy to production (manual approval)
- [ ] Post-deployment health checks

**Container Registry**:
- [ ] Choose registry (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, etc.)
- [ ] Set up registry credentials
- [ ] Configure image tagging strategy
- [ ] Set up image scanning for vulnerabilities

### 4. Monitoring & Observability ⏳
**Priority**: HIGH | **Estimated Time**: 1 day

**Application Monitoring**:
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry/Rollbar)
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot/Pingdom)
- [ ] Configure alerting for critical errors

**Infrastructure Monitoring**:
- [ ] Monitor Docker container health
- [ ] Track PostgreSQL performance
- [ ] Monitor Redis memory usage
- [ ] Track Celery queue lengths
- [ ] Set up disk space alerts

**Logging**:
- [ ] Configure centralized logging
- [ ] Set up log rotation
- [ ] Configure log levels for production
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (optional: ELK stack)

### 5. Backup & Recovery ⏳
**Priority**: CRITICAL | **Estimated Time**: 0.5 days

**Database Backup**:
- [ ] Set up automated PostgreSQL backups
- [ ] Configure backup retention policy
- [ ] Test backup restoration process
- [ ] Document recovery procedures

**Data Protection**:
- [ ] Backup analysis results
- [ ] Backup application configuration
- [ ] Set up offsite backup storage

## Nice to Have (Can Deploy Without)

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates
- [ ] Export functionality (PDF/Excel)
- [ ] Advanced search filters
- [ ] Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Load balancing setup
- [ ] CDN configuration
- [ ] A/B testing framework
- [ ] User authentication (when needed for premium features)

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Verification
- [ ] All tests passing (backend & frontend)
- [ ] Production build successful
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Complete Google Analytics integration
2. [ ] Set up production infrastructure
3. [ ] Configure CI/CD pipelines
4. [ ] Deploy to staging environment
5. [ ] Run full test suite on staging
6. [ ] Performance testing on staging
7. [ ] Security audit
8. [ ] Deploy to production
9. [ ] Verify production deployment
10. [ ] Monitor for 24 hours

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Google Analytics integration (simple, well-documented)
- Basic monitoring setup (standard tools available)

### Medium Risk
- SSL/TLS configuration (requires domain setup)
- CI/CD pipeline (needs testing and iteration)

### High Risk
- Production database migration (requires careful planning)
- Secret management (critical for security)

## Timeline

**Total Estimated Time**: 4-5 days

### Recommended Schedule
- **Day 1 Morning**: Google Analytics setup (2-3 hours)
- **Day 1-2**: Production configuration
- **Day 3-4**: CI/CD pipeline implementation
- **Day 5**: Monitoring, testing, and deployment

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Zero downtime deployment achieved
- [ ] < 3 second page load time
- [ ] 99.9% uptime target
- [ ] All security headers configured
- [ ] Automated backups running

### Business Metrics (via Google Analytics)
- [ ] Tracking unique visitors
- [ ] Monitoring user engagement
- [ ] Tracking most viewed companies/filings
- [ ] Analysis request conversion rate
- [ ] Error rate < 1%

## Notes

### Why Google Analytics Instead of Authentication?
Based on current requirements:
- **No user-specific features needed** at launch
- **Simpler implementation** (2-3 hours vs 2-3 days)
- **Better insights** out of the box
- **No security burden** (no passwords, no GDPR concerns for auth)
- **Lower maintenance** (no password resets, account recovery)
- **Faster time to market** (can deploy 2 days sooner)

### When to Add Authentication
Consider adding authentication when:
- Users need saved searches or watchlists
- Premium features are introduced
- API rate limiting per user is needed
- Personalized dashboards are required
- Collaboration features are added
