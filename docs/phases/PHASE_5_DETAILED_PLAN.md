# Phase 5: Presentation Layer - Web UI Implementation Plan

## Overview

Phase 5 focuses on building a **user-friendly web interface** that transforms complex SEC filings into accessible financial insights. This phase brings Aperilex's mission to life by creating an intuitive dashboard that makes financial analysis as easy as reading a news article.

**Mission Alignment**: "Democratize financial analysis by making SEC filings as easy to understand as reading a news article."

**Key Objective**: Build a modern, responsive web application that consumes the Phase 4 REST API to deliver powerful financial analysis tools to users of all expertise levels.

## Architecture Principles

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component-Based Design**: Modular, reusable UI components
- **State Management**: Centralized state for complex data flows
- **API Integration Layer**: Clean separation between UI and API calls
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop optimization

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 for utility-first design
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight state management
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Charts**: Recharts for financial data visualization
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom theming
